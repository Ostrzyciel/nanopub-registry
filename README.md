# Nanopub Registry

This code base is in design phase. See the [design document](design.md).

The Nanopub Registry implements a publication/lookup service as envisaged by the [Knowledge Space](https://w3id.org/knowledge-space/).

The Nanopub Registry is designed as the next-generation publication/lookup service for nanopublications, to supersede the
[nanopub-server](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-server).
